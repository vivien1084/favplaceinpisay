		<h2>SPLASH SECTION</h2>
		<p>Hi, to whoever is reading this! This website was created solely for our CS3 class in PSHS - Main Campus!
		That's not to say that it wasn't fun to make, although I can hardly decide that seeing as I (Rain) only helped with
		the content and not particularly the code. Pisay, both as an environment and an education system, is entirely stressful
		and hardly leaves its students with room to breathe, for even just a moment, so it's very crucial that we still find 
		ourselves with happy, peaceful places. These in our website just so happen to be those which we favour over others , 
		and its nice to have that; to have something, that at the end of the day we can go back to and find comfort 
		in, even noisy, distracting areas, or sullen, hollow ones. It's in this way that we can appreciate support systems 
		that come in all forms, not just in friend groups or conversations. :D</p>

							<br>The dorm isn't my favorite place because of the place itself,

							to this day, remain with me, laughing with me during good days, and helping 
							me through bad ones. It's practically like my second home at this point.

							<br><b><i>Why?</i></b></br>
							<br> By no means do PE and 1 Mile Run have anything

							simply just to relax. Generally, I just feel happy when we do an 
							'Oval Walk' even if the day has made me excruciatingly tired.

							<br><b><i>Why?</i></b></br>
							<br>Throughout the course of the many sports I've tried,

							Even if everyone prefers Frisbee, I just couldn't seem to
							grow to enjoy it, but even if I only started liking Basketball 
							now, and even if I'm one of the more amateur members of my club, it still makes me happy.

							would take up one of the tables to eat together. Also, at 
							the time, there were many concessionaires to choose from,

							<br>I only recently began going to the library,

							and bean bags. It's very comfortable there, to sleep, to study, 
							and especially so when there aren't many people around. It's my 
							go-to place for lunch or study period.

							<div class="year">1. Library </div>
							<div class="title">
							<br><b><i>Why?</i></b></br>

<br>The Library is a cold, comfortable place that was the first ever reason
 for me to feel like I'd be okay in Pisay. As clich√© as it sounds, having books
 surround me fills me with a peace that I scarcely every experience nowadays. 
 The beanbags provide me with a place to sleep, and the tables provide me with 
 a place to study. It's as perfect a place can get in a school like Pisay, or at 
 the very least, it's as perfect a place can get for someone like me.

							<div class="year">2. Kalachuchi Lane</div>
							<div class="title">
							<br><b><i>Why?</i></b></br>

<br> As someone who considers herself an artist, there's just something
 intrinsically beautiful to me about the way flowers fall from the trees 
 and onto the ground. Or maybe I watch too much anime. In any case, I just
 love spending my time at the Kalachuchi lane, to talk with my friends, to 
 sit and think, or just to rest. Even more beautiful is its state at night,
 with the lamps hanging from the branches illuminating the darkness.</div>

							<div class="year">3. 2A Extension</br></div>
							<div class="title">
							<br><b><i>Why?</i></b></br>

<br>My friends are as close as I get to family in Pisay, but I was truly surprised 
to realize one day that a club could mean more than a hobby to me. Every Monday and 
Wednesday, Invictus holds its annual meeting at the 2A Extension, and the rush of prepping
 fills me with stress, but by God is the thrill and fun worth it. I've found myself a makeshift 
 little family in Invictus, and I wouldn't trade them for the world.</div>

							<div class="title">
							<br><b><i>Why?</i></b></br>

<br> Stress is easy to come by in Pisay, but I'm grateful every day that I have 
friends who help me through it. The Oval has been a place of ritual since 7th grade, 
since the day that drama started and I needed to talk my feelings out, and from that 
came the tradition of "Oval Walk", where, if need be, we'd just circle around the oval
 and talk about anything we wished to let out.</br></div>

							<br><b><i>Why?</i></b></br>

<br>The Gazebos of Pisay feel the most wonderful on Sundays, 
or days where class is suspended, because there's something 
about having some place all to yourself that makes it all the
 better. I love getting delivery there, and laughing with my 
 friends, and studying for tests whenever the place is near-empty,
 because it feels almost homely in a sense.</br></div>

	<br>
	Hi this is Rain again, and still not Vivien, because she's playing ML right now. 
	She did probably ALL the coding for the project, whereas my contibution will be 
	acknowledged on my part of the author section. Viv is really cool even if, as proven above,
	her tastes are really weird. Wanna know a secret? I actually made her content for her HAHAHAHA, 
	but I still kept in in first person because I'd like to think that I know her well enough to be 
	capable of embodying her. Did I fool you? Well, whatever the case, she practically did everything
	on her own, so for that: SALAMAAAAT VIVIII.
	</div>
	<div class="author">
	<i><h1>Rain Santos</h1></i>
	<br>
	Hiiiii, I'm Rain again again and I'm STILL really bad at CS! But yknow what, 
	I only made the content and the decisions on the design and layout plus the 
	color scheme so technically I helped? I dunno. Those ARE all aspects of the project,
	so doesn't it SORTA count for something? It was actually kind of fun making the content 
	and trying to impersonate Viv, I guess? The project itself was ehhh... comsci REALLY isn't
	my thing, but thankfully our teacher is nice enough to allow us to do things by pair!! So yeah, 
	THANK U RIN TO SIR PAO and well, yeah I guess that's it :0000
